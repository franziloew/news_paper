German federal elections took place on 24th of September 2017 and the formation of the government has taken up a period of about five months and the discussion about the influence of digital media on the political opinion-forming process has gained momentum since the presidential elections in October 2016. In order to address the question whether the media landscape transmits a biased reality of the political landscape, this study analyzes German online news articles covering domestic politics together with press releases of the party in the german "Bundestag". The data contains online news articles from seven major news provider dated from June 1, 2017 to March 1, 2018. We use state-of-the art text-mining techniques to analyze a corpus of over 15.000 online news articles an nearly 1.800 press releases.
