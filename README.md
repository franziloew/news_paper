# Media Bias

Online articles provide the unique opportunity to access, analyse and compare a large body of text data using state of the art text mining techniques.

In order to address the question whether the media landscape transmits a biased reality of the political landscape, this paper analyzes German online news articles covering domestic politics together with press releases of the party in the german "Bundestag". The data contains online news articles from seven major news provider dated from June 1, 2017 to March 1, 2018. As the German federal elections took place on 24th of September 2017 and the formation of the government has taken up a period of about five months, the articles considered inform their readers about both the election promises of the parties (before the election) and the coalition talks (after the election). We use state-of-the art text-mining techniques to analyze a corpus of over 15.000 online news articles an nearly 1.800 press releases. Online articles and press releases provide the opportunity to access, analyse and compare a large body of text data using state of the art text mining techniques. Earlier studies that analyse the effect of media content on voter behaviour primarily employ manual content analysis and are therefore much more time-consuming and susceptible to errors.
