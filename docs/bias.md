Different types of media bias - compare with polls

We use the data from the "Sonntagsumfrage" (Sunday survey) from [infratest dimap](https://www.infratest-dimap.de/umfragen-analysen/bundesweit/sonntagsfrage/). The institution regularly asks at least 1000 German citizens the question: "Which party would you choose if federal elections take place next Sunday?" The survey thus measures the current election tendencies and therefore reflects an intermediate state in the opinion-forming process of the electoral population.

To compare the metrics we normalize all values between -1 and 1.
